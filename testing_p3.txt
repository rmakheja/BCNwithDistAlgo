	t = 1
	num_clients = 4
	failures[0,2] = shuttle(1,4), change_result();

	Scenario tested : 

			Pseudorandom workload is generated. Result at tail is changed due to failure trigger on shuttle

	Expected behavior : 

			tail should append hash of 'OK' in the result statement. But, client accepts the result as in the result proof t+1 correct hashes are present. The client will proceed to next request

			If the original result was 'OK', there will be no mismatch
